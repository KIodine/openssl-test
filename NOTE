- Keys generated via `genrsa`(RSA) or `ec`(Elliptic Curve) are
  stored with `ASN.1-DER` **binary** format and encoded into
  `PEM`(Privacy Enhanced Mail) format, which is base64 encoded.
- The packaging view will be:
  - Certificate/Key:
    PEM-----------------+  : base64 encoded
    |  DER ASN.1--------+  : binary format
    |  |  X.509---------+  : entries data must have
    |  |  |  <data...>  |
    +--+--+-------------+
- `openssl rand -hex -out <file> <bytes>` generates random bytes,
  which is useful for making a passpharse for key file.
- Part of openssl subcmd can be configured via prepared file and
  they have own default config section to read.
  For config file reading:
  - Openssl config generals.

  - X509v3 configs.
